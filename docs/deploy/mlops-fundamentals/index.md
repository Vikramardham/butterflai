# MLOps Fundamentals

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to streamline and automate ML workflows from development to production. This guide covers the fundamental principles and practices of MLOps that every AI team should implement.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. It's the intersection of:

- **Machine Learning**: Creating models that learn from data
- **DevOps**: Combining software development and IT operations
- **Data Engineering**: Building systems for data collection and processing

## The MLOps Lifecycle

The MLOps lifecycle encompasses several stages:

1. **Data Management**: Collection, validation, and preparation of data
2. **Model Development**: Experimentation, training, and evaluation
3. **Deployment**: Packaging and deploying models to production
4. **Monitoring**: Tracking model performance and behavior
5. **Governance**: Ensuring compliance, security, and ethics
6. **Iteration**: Continuous improvement and retraining

## Core Principles of MLOps

### 1. Version Control for Code, Data, and Models

Tracking changes is essential for reproducibility and collaboration:

```bash
# Code versioning with Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial model training code"

# Data and model versioning with DVC
pip install dvc
dvc init
dvc add data/training_data.csv
dvc add models/trained_model.pkl
git add .dvc* data.dvc models.dvc
git commit -m "Add training data and model"
dvc push
```

### 2. Reproducible Pipelines

Creating reproducible workflows ensures consistency:

```python
# Example using MLflow
import mlflow
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

# Set up tracking
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("customer_churn_prediction")

# Create a pipeline
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 5)
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.85)
    mlflow.log_metric("precision", 0.82)
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

### 3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Automating testing and deployment with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for ML
name: ML Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/
    - name: Run model validation
      run: |
        python scripts/validate_model.py
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python scripts/deploy_model.py
```

### 4. Model Packaging and Containerization

Packaging models for deployment:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for model serving
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY model/ model/
COPY app.py .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

```python
# app.py - FastAPI application for model serving
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI(title="Churn Prediction API")
model = joblib.load("model/model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(features: dict):
    df = pd.DataFrame([features])
    prediction = model.predict(df)[0]
    probability = model.predict_proba(df)[0][1]
    return {
        "prediction": int(prediction),
        "probability": float(probability)
    }
```

### 5. Automated Model Monitoring

Setting up monitoring to detect model drift:

```python
# Example using EvidencelyAI for monitoring
from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
from evidently.dashboard.tabs import DataDriftTab, ClassificationPerformanceTab
from evidently.pipeline.column_mapping import ColumnMapping

# Load reference and current data
reference_data = pd.read_csv("data/reference.csv")
current_data = pd.read_csv("data/current.csv")

# Configure column mapping
column_mapping = ColumnMapping(
    target="churn",
    prediction="prediction",
    numerical_features=["tenure", "monthly_charges", "total_charges"],
    categorical_features=["gender", "partner", "dependents", "phone_service"]
)

# Create a dashboard
dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[
    DataDriftTab(),
    ClassificationPerformanceTab()
])

# Calculate metrics
dashboard.calculate(reference_data, current_data, column_mapping=column_mapping)

# Save the report
dashboard.save("monitoring_report.html")
```

### 6. Feature Stores

Centralizing feature engineering and management:

```python
# Example using Feast feature store
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from feast import FeatureStore

# Initialize the feature store
store = FeatureStore(repo_path="feature_repo")

# Get training data
training_df = store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entities,
    features=[
        "customer_features:age",
        "customer_features:tenure",
        "transaction_features:average_purchase",
        "transaction_features:purchase_frequency"
    ],
).to_df()

# Get online features for prediction
features = store.get_online_features(
    features=[
        "customer_features:age",
        "customer_features:tenure",
        "transaction_features:average_purchase",
        "transaction_features:purchase_frequency"
    ],
    entity_rows=[{"customer_id": "1234"}]
).to_dict()
```

### 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Managing ML infrastructure using code:

```terraform
# Terraform example for ML infrastructure
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "model_artifacts" {
  bucket = "company-ml-artifacts"
  acl    = "private"
  
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}

resource "aws_sagemaker_model" "churn_prediction" {
  name = "churn-prediction-model"
  execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_role.arn
  
  primary_container {
    image = "${aws_ecr_repository.model_repo.repository_url}:latest"
    model_data_url = "s3://${aws_s3_bucket.model_artifacts.bucket}/models/churn/model.tar.gz"
  }
}

resource "aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration" "churn_endpoint_config" {
  name = "churn-endpoint-config"
  
  production_variants {
    variant_name = "default"
    model_name = aws_sagemaker_model.churn_prediction.name
    initial_instance_count = 1
    instance_type = "ml.m5.large"
  }
}

resource "aws_sagemaker_endpoint" "churn_endpoint" {
  name = "churn-endpoint"
  endpoint_configuration_name = aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration.churn_endpoint_config.name
}
```
